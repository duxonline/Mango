```
	/* Log Ladbrokes request and response here */
	var timeMS = (new Date()).getTime();

	var requestFileName = "C:\\Fiddler\\" + timeMS + "_Request.txt";
	var requestBodyFileName = "C:\\Fiddler\\" + timeMS + "_RequestBody.txt";
		
	var responseFileName = "C:\\Fiddler\\" + timeMS + "_Response.txt";
	var responseBodyFileName = "C:\\Fiddler\\" + timeMS + "_ResponseBody.txt";
